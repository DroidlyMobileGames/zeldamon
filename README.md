Welcome to 2023!

Game development can be hard, but it should be fun!  So I have decided to share with you my game development projects while sharing video tutorials on understanding how to make your own 2D RPG Style game using Android Studio!

This game (yes I named it based off 2 of my childhood favourites) is going to be a Zelda Pokemon mashup!  The first 10 videos are going to be all about adding our player and on screen controls with collision & drawing our world!  I can't wait to share everything I have in store with you guys for this series!

Subscribe to me on YouTube to view more of this funtastic game we are going to make and learn how to make together!
